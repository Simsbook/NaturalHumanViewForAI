## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your machine:

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Get a copy of the repository on your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Simsbook/NaturalHumanViewForAI.git
cd NaturalHumanViewForAI
```

---

### **2. Set Up Your Environment**
We recommend using a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

#### **Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

#### **Activate the Virtual Environment**
- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### **3. File Structure**
The repository contains the following files:

```
NaturalHumanViewForAI/
├── README.md                  # Project overview and instructions
├── architecture.md            # Project architecture documentation
├── demo.py                    # Demo script showcasing functionality
├── main.py                    # Main entry point of the application
├── object_recognition.py      # Recognizes objects in images
├── rgb_to_hsv.py              # Converts RGB images to HSV
└── test_rgb_to_hsv.py         # Unit tests for the RGB to HSV module
```

---

### **4. Run the Project**
To process an image:
```bash
python main.py --image <path_to_image>
```

For example:
```bash
python main.py --image sample_images/sample.jpg
```

---

### **5. Run the Tests**
Make sure everything works as expected:
```bash
pytest
```

## 🛠 Features

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Converts images from RGB to HSV for a human-like color representation.

2. **Perception**:
   - Recognizes objects in preprocessed images using AI models.

3. **Demo**:
   - Includes a sample script (`demo.py`) to showcase its capabilities.
