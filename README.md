# 🌟 Welcome to **NaturalHumanViewForAI**!

Transform your AI's perception by replacing traditional scanner views with a **natural, human-like view**. This project is designed to make AI systems process visual data more efficiently and intuitively, just like the human eye does.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your machine:

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Get a copy of the repository on your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Simsbook/NaturalHumanViewForAI.git
cd NaturalHumanViewForAI
```

---

### **2. Set Up Your Environment**
We recommend using a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

#### **Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

#### **Activate the Virtual Environment**
- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
---

### **3. Recommended directory Structure**
Organize the files as follows:
```
NaturalHumanViewForAI/
├── src/
│   ├── main.py                # Main entry point of the application
│   ├── preprocessing/
│   │   └── rgb_to_hsv.py      # Converts RGB images to HSV
│   └── perception/
│       └── object_recognition.py # Recognizes objects in images
├── tests/
│   └── test_rgb_to_hsv.py     # Unit tests for the RGB to HSV module
├── examples/
│   └── demo.py                # Demo script showcasing functionality
├── docs/
│   └── architecture.md        # Project architecture documentation
└── README.md                  # Project overview and instructions
```

---

### **4. Run the Project**
To process an image:
```bash
python src/main.py --image <path_to_image>
```

For example:
```bash
python src/main.py --image examples/sample_images/sample.jpg
```

---

### **5. Run the Tests**
Make sure everything works as expected:
```bash
pytest
```

## 🛠 Features

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Converts images from RGB to HSV for a human-like color representation.

2. **Perception**:
   - Recognizes objects in preprocessed images using AI models.

3. **Demo**:
   - Includes a sample script (`examples/demo.py`) to showcase its capabilities.
